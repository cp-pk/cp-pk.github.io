            <h2>Effective Date: January 20, 2025</h2>
            <p>PK Labs LLC ("we," "us," or "our") operates the website https://www.pk-labs.org (the "Website") and the mobile application PouchKinetics (the "App"). This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect information when you visit our Website or use our App.</p>

            <h3>1. PouchKinetics Mobile Application</h3>
            <p><strong>No Data Collection:</strong> The PouchKinetics app operates entirely on your device and does not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal data or usage information. All data you enter (including nicotine usage logs, personal settings, and health information) remains exclusively on your device and is never sent to our servers or any third parties.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> Any data you create within the app is stored locally on your device using Apple's Core Data framework. This data is never transmitted outside of your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.</p>
            
            <p><strong>No Analytics or Tracking:</strong> The app does not use any analytics services, crash reporting tools, or tracking technologies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>No Third-Party Services:</strong> The app does not integrate with any third-party services that could access your data.</p>

            <h3>2. PK-Labs.org Website</h3>

                <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We may collect non-personal data about your interactions with the Website, such as IP address, browser type, and pages visited, through standard web server logs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. How We Use Website Information</h3>

            <h3>5. Cookies and Web Technologies</h3>
            <p>Our Website may use standard web technologies such as cookies for basic functionality. You can control cookie preferences through your browser settings. The PouchKinetics app does not use cookies or web technologies.</p>

            <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
            <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect any information we collect. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. For the PouchKinetics app, since no data leaves your device, the security of your data depends on your device's security settings.</p>

            <h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>

            <h3>8. International Data Transfers</h3>
            <p>Any website data we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States. The PouchKinetics app processes all data locally on your device, so no international transfers occur.</p>
